# medal_prediction_model
Predicting how many medals a country will win at the Olympics by using historical data.

Here, we are using mean squared error. This is a good default regression accuracy metric. It's the average of squared differences between the actual results and the predictions.

This model works well for countries that have a high medal count, and compete in a stable number of events annually.
